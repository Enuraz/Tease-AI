# Changelog - Patch 43

08/21 1:24 am - Added Chastity state toggle to Misc tab in Settings menu

08/21 11:36 pm - Added System Keywords #CBTBallsCount and #CBTCockCount. These words are replaced with an integer representing the number of times those routines have been called. These can be used in Operations as well.

08/21 4:20 am - Added ability to create Custom Tasks that work the same way as @CBTBalls and @CBTCock. User creates scripts "Filename.txt" and "Filename_First.txt" and places them in \Custom\Tasks\, and calls them from Linear scripts with @CustomTask() (e.g, @CustomTask(Filename)).
