# Tease-AI
Tease AI is adult-oriented software that aims to create an interactive tease and denial experience by emulating an online chat session with a domme. 

Changelog:

08/21 4:20 am - Added ability to create Custom Tasks that work the same way as @CBTBalls and @CBTCock. User creates scripts "Filename.txt" and "Filename_First.txt" and places them in \Custom\Tasks\, and calls them from Linear scripts with @CustomTask() (e.g, @CustomTask(Filename)).
